# AI Question Answering and Image Processing Website

This is an AI-powered web application that can answer questions, analyze images to describe their content, and generate beautiful images from text prompts. Built using Python and Flask, and hosted on Render, it leverages the Gemini API and GPT4Free Library to perform AI-driven tasks.

## Features

**Question Answering**: The AI can answer any question using natural language processing and web search capabilities.

**Image Analysis**: Upload an image, and the AI will describe what's in the image.

**Image Generation**: Create stunning images based on user-provided text prompts.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction with the AI capabilities.


## Technologies Used

**Backend**: Python, Flask

**AI & Image Processing**: Gemini API and GPT4Free library

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Hosting**: Render server


## How It Works

1. **Ask Questions**: Users can type questions, and the AI will use advanced natural language processing to provide accurate answers.


2. **Analyze Images**: Users can upload an image, and the AI will detect objects and provide descriptions of what's visible in the image.


3. **Generate Images**: Based on a user's text prompt, the AI will create visually stunning images.
